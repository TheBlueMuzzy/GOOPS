<objective>
Audit naming inconsistencies and create official glossary for game terminology.

Purpose: Establish authoritative naming conventions to eliminate confusion in code, docs, and discussions.
Output: GLOSSARY.md with official terms, AUDIT.md documenting what needs renaming in Phase 23.

**Known inconsistencies (from STATE.md):**
- piece vs goop (580 vs 180 occurrences)
- unit vs cell (43 vs 370 occurrences)
- softDrop vs fastDrop (29 occurrences, vestigial from old hard drop)
- block overlapping with goop (76 occurrences)

**Audit results (already gathered):**
| Term Pair | Files | Occurrences | Priority |
|-----------|-------|-------------|----------|
| piece vs goop | 63/55 | 580/180 | HIGH |
| unit vs cell | 19/41 | 43/370 | HIGH |
| softDrop | 16 | 29 | MEDIUM |
| block (overlaps goop) | 28 | 76 | MEDIUM |

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create official GLOSSARY.md</name>
  <files>.planning/GLOSSARY.md</files>
  <action>
Create `.planning/GLOSSARY.md` defining official game terminology.

Structure:
1. Core Game Objects section
2. Grid & Positioning section
3. Player Actions section
4. Game Systems section

Definitions to establish:
- **Piece** = Active falling polyomino shape (Tetra/Penta/Hexa). The thing the player controls.
- **Goop** = Settled substance on the grid. What pieces become after locking.
- **Cell** = Single 1x1 grid square. A position on the tank.
- **Block** = The content of a cell. A cell can contain goop or be empty.
- **Group** = Contiguous connected blocks of same color. What gets popped.
- **Fast Drop** = Player-triggered acceleration (holding down). Replaces "soft drop".
- **Crack** = Damage on tank wall. Sealing cracks is the core goal.
- **Complication** = Difficulty mechanic (Laser, Lights, Controls).
- **Upgrade** = Player progression reward (passive, active, or feature).

Include usage examples showing correct vs incorrect terminology.
Do NOT include emojis.

  <name>Task 2: Create rename audit document</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/22-audit-glossary/AUDIT.md</files>
  <action>
Create detailed audit document listing every file/location that needs renaming in Phase 23.

Structure by category:

**1. softDrop → fastDrop (16 files, 29 occurrences)**
List each file with line numbers and what to rename:
- core/GameEngine.ts: SOFT_DROP_FACTOR constant, isSoftDropping variable
- types.ts: softDrop references
- hooks/useInputHandlers.ts: soft drop comments
- etc.

**2. unit → block (for complication tracking)**
List files using "totalUnitsAdded", "totalUnitsPopped" etc:
- types.ts: GameState interface fields
- complicationConfig.ts: threshold descriptions
- core/ComplicationManager.ts: unit references

**3. BlockData considerations**
Note: BlockData interface in types.ts is fine - it represents block content.
No rename needed, just document the relationship to GLOSSARY terms.

**4. piece/goop usage**
Document the INTENDED usage pattern (don't list every occurrence):
- "piece" for falling/active objects = CORRECT in code
- "goop" for settled blocks = use in user-facing text, comments
- Code variables: piece (falling), blocks (settled content)

Format as checklist for Phase 23 to work through.

- [ ] GLOSSARY.md defines all core terms (piece, goop, cell, block, group, fast drop, crack, complication, upgrade)
- [ ] AUDIT.md exists in phase directory
- [ ] AUDIT.md has actionable checklist for Phase 23 renaming
