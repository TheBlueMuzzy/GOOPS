# Phase 27.1: Physics-Controlled Active Piece - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-05
**Status:** Ready for research

<vision>
## How This Should Work

The falling piece is controlled by physics — smooth gravity fall until it hits locked goop or the floor. No more syncing blob position TO game state (which causes flickering). Physics owns the motion directly, like Proto-9.

Player controls remain identical:
- Q/E keys and left/right screen taps rotate the piece
- Fast-fall works as before (research needed on best physics approach)
- Landing gives a brief grace period to adjust before locking
- Piece swap continues to work

The rotation should use Proto-9's tuned physics feel, but triggered by the existing Q/E and screen tap controls (not the prototype's button).

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Player experience unchanged** — Rotating, stopping on landing, grace period to adjust, fast-fall, piece swap all work exactly as they do now
- **Mechanics work end-to-end** — Physics falling integrates cleanly with existing game systems (lock detection, scoring, etc.)
- **No flickering** — The timing mismatch that blocks 27-02 rendering must be solved

</essential>

## What's Out of Scope

- **Visual polish** — Focus on mechanics working; goo filter and prettiness comes later
- **Mobile optimization** — Get it working on desktop first; mobile perf is Phase 30
- **Locked goop physics** — Once piece locks, hand off cleanly; Phase 28 handles locked behavior

</boundaries>

## Specific Ideas

- Use Proto-9's rotation physics feel (already tuned to feel right)
- Research needed: which fast-fall approach (gravity boost vs velocity injection) matches current feel and works with SBG
- Lock detection via collision rather than timer (Proto-9 pattern)

</specifics>

<notes>
## Additional Context

Current problem: 27-02 rendering shows flickering because GameEngine position updates and physics simulation have timing mismatches. This phase fixes that by making physics the source of truth for falling motion.

Existing controls to preserve:
- Q/E keyboard rotation
- Left/right screen tap rotation
- Fast-fall (current trigger method)
- Piece swap
